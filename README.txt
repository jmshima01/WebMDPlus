How to run the application:
(1) Make sure you are connected to the mines network/isengard (using vpn if needed).
(2) Open the WebMDPlus folder and run main.py however you prefer.
(3) You may need to pip install sklearn and tkinter or any other libriaries you get an error for.
(4) If you have all the libraries required, when you run main.py the UI should load.
(5) Input your info (real or fake) and the symptom pull downs.
(6) May take a second to load results and insert them into the f22_group6 schema!
(7) See the results and possibly see a doctor!
