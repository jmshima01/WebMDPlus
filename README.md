2) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hagari/disease-and-their-symptoms <- For this dataset, I have no idea how to verify that all of these diseases and symptoms are correct. Could someone find a way to check this data?
3) NCHS_-_Leading_Causes_of_Death__United_States.csv <------ Add hyperlink to source later
4) raw_hospital_mortality dataset-> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/in-hospital-mortality-prediction/discussion

For those looking at the ERD diagram-
1) Do not erase names like 'symptom_name' or 'disease_name' from the ERD. These were used to make the creation of tables easier. Will erase later since it is bad SQL practice to leave those relational names there. We will eventually use them to merge one table with another.
