# CSCI403 - Group 6

Project Description:

Kaggle Link(s): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset?select=dataset.csv

For those looking at the ERD diagram-
1) Do not erase names like 'symptom_name' or 'disease_name'. These were used to make the creation of tables easier. Will erase later since it is bad SQL practice to leave those names there, even though we will use them to merge one table with another.
